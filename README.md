# Thyroid_Disease_PowerBi

Your thyroid is a small, butterfly-shaped gland situated at the base of the front of your neck, just below your Adam's apple. Hormones produced by the thyroid gland — triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) — have an enormous impact on your health, affecting all aspects of your metabolism.
There are 2 types of Thyroid diseases - Hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism.
Hypothyroidism is a condition where the thyroid gland is not able to produce sufficient amount of thyroid hormone. Whereas in hyperthyroidism the gland produces excess amount of thyroid hormone. 
Here is a Visualisation of a dataset using power_bi that is giving us some more insights about the thyroid cases.
