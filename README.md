# Thyroid_Disease_PowerBi

Our thyroid is a small, butterfly-shaped gland situated at the base of the front of your neck. Hormones produced by the thyroid gland — triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) — have an enormous impact on your health, affecting all aspects of your metabolism.
There are 2 types of Thyroid diseases - Hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism.
Hypothyroidism is a condition where the thyroid gland is not able to produce sufficient amount of thyroid hormone. Whereas in hyperthyroidism the gland produces excess amount of thyroid hormone. 

Here I performed the operations like Data cleaning using Power Query Editor and data visualization using the business intellegence tool Power BI and created dashboards that gives us the detailed insights of the data and helps in making data driven decisions. Also perfomed using various types of charts, graphs, scorecards, etc, to draw detailed disease insights.
